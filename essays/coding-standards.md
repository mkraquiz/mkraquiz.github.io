I have been working with ESLint in IntelliJ for the past week. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript code. From my experience, using ESLint is both useful and painful. It is useful in a way that it will let you know when there's an error with your code. It will make it easier to make your code work.
