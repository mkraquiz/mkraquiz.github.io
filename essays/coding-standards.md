Coding Standards
---
What is coding standards? Coding standards is a bunch of coding rules or guidelines to make your code neat, clear, and easy to find the errors. Every programming language has its own coding standards and this standards will actually help you learn the programming language.

Coding standards has it's advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages would be your code will be easy to read and easy to maintain, it will help detect error easily, and it increases the efficiency of the programmer. However, the disadvantage of coding standards is that it limits the programmer to be creative and just stick to the standards that the language being used has. 

Working with ESLint

I have been working with ESLint in IntelliJ for the past week. ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript code. From my experience, using ESLint is both useful and painful. It is useful in a way that it will let you know when there's an error with your code. It will make it easier to make your code work and it will suggest to you how you can fix your errors. But what is painful with this is that when you fix the errors, sometimes it will create more errors. It can be frustating at times too because you just want to get that green check mark at the top right corner of your window and know that your code is functioning.
