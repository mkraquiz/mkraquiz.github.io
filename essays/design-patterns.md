Understanding Design Patterns
---
First of all, what is design patterns? According to the dictionary, 

    "A design pattern is a general repeatble solution to a commonly occurring
    problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that 
    can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for 
    how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations."
