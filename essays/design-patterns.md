Understanding Design Patterns
---
First of all, what is design patterns? According to the dictionary, 


    "A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring
    problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that 
    can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for 
    how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations." 
    
    
Software engineers are documenting solutions to commonly occurring problems so they don't have to start from scratch when it comes to solving problems. These documented solutions can speed up the development process by providing tested examples. Design patterns are divided into a lot of categories and here are the most common design patterns categories:

Do I Use Design Patterns?

When I was asked "what design patterns have you used in your own code?", I wasn't exactly sure how to answer it. I don't even know if I even used design patterns in my own code before. Then I looked up what design pattern is and I didn't even realized that I have been using design patterns and I just didn't know that I am. A recent example of when I used design patterns was for my final project that I am currently working on with my groupmates in my Software Engineering class.
