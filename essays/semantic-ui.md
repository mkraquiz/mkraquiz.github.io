Working with Semantic UI

For the past week, I have been learning and working with Semantic UI. I've watched a lot of videos about Semantic UI like its elements, collections, views, modules, and API to understand how it works and how to use it. I've spent about 3 hours watching videos by Nate Taylor on [PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/semantic-ui-2-0/table-of-contents) teaching the viewers how to work with Semantic UI. These videos were very helpful as it define everything first and gives examples on how to use it.

Building web pages got a little simpler using Semantic UI. We have been recreating web pages as a practice for Semantic UI and I can say that it is a lot simpler because you can just put what you want to happen and it will understand and do what you say. For example, if you want to put a Facebook icon on your  page you can just simply put:
	       
         <a class="item"><i class="facebook f icon"></i></a>

If you want to make the icon bigger of smaller, you can just specify it and put "large" or "tiny". There's a lot more you can include to your website like buttons, labels, etc. and the [Semantic UI website](https://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html) offers different ways and designs to include the items that you want in your web pages. 

Because of its simplicity, it makes me excited to work with frameworks. I was able te recreate web pages. Even though it speeds up the development of an front end application, it does not mean its easier. It can still be frustating at times because you really have to make your words specific otherwise it will not do what you want it to do. Overall, UI frameworks help a lot with building or recreating web pages.
