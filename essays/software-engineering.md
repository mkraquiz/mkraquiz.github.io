Now that the semester (Fall 2020) is almost over, I gained a lot more information on software engineering. I learned and worked with JavaScript, HTML, Meteor, and many more during the semester. I was able to apply what I learned in my Software Engineering class through developing a web application. 


Issue Driven Project Management

For the final project of my Software Engineering class, I had to work in a group and develop a web application. We were given a topic and had to create a web application for about four weeks. To keep us organized and to make sure everyone is working and contributing to the project, we followed the [Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) Guidelines](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f20/morea/project-management/reading-guidelines-idpm.html). The guideline helped my group a lot because it suggested that we create a project board which will show what issue each member has and working on. It also suggested that we meet at least twice a week and divide the work into 72 hours. Without the guideline I think my group will have a hard time being organize and keeping track of what needs to be done.


Open Source Software Development

Fisrt of all, what is "open source software developmet"? It is basically a software that you developed and is accessable by public. When my group developed our web application, it was very exciting to think I get to finally develop and publish an application for everyone to use. I was able to apply what I learned from my Software Engineering class and develop pages that are part of the application. I was very happy with the outcome of our web application until we had to get community feedback. I was satisfied with outcome of our web application but I can't help it to get nervous what the public or community have to say about it. Seeing the response from the community, they were also satisfied with the looks and features of our application but of course there are things that we need to improve and add to our application.
