summary: I updated the product information for the new website of the company I was working for.
---

Last year, the company that I was working for changed the website that they are using to better serve their costumers. Because it is a new website, we need to transfer all of the information from the old website to the new one. My advisor assigned me to update/input all of the information for each of the products that we have. 

For each product, I need to include the name of the product, the author, when it was published, version it is available (PDF, ePub, soft cover, hard cover), ISBN (International Standard Book Number), the weight (will be needed to calculate the shipping fee), and the price. In addition to inputting product's information, I also need to check the shipping cost from USPS and FedEx. 

After inputting the information needed for the products, we need to make sure that the website is ready to be used. We tested if the website will show the correct amount the customer will need pay (product with the shipping cost) and if the payment method is working properly.
