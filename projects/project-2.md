The Center for Philippine Studies at University of Hawaii at Manoa held a conference last year(2019). I was working for the department that organized the conference as a student assistant. My part for the conference is to help out with setting up the equipments that will be needed and used during the event. I need to make sure that the speaker is connecting to the laptop that will be used to keep the timer and play the background music.
